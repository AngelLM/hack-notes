I remember when I was younger I was very interested in hackers, programming and that kind of stuff. Back then I barely knew how to program and it all seemed very complex to me. Now, although it still seems to me a pretty difficult world, I have decided to get interested and start learning.&#x20;

Here you can find writeups of the machines I have completed on platforms like **Hack The Box** or **TryHackMe**, as well as some resources that I find useful.
