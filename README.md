# whoami

My name is Angel and here I am sharing my learning about cybersecurity. \
I started in this world not so much to pursue it professionally, but out of pure curiosity, and the truth is that I've enjoyed it.&#x20;

I remember when I was younger I was very interested in hackers, programming and that kind of stuff. Back then I barely knew how to program and it all seemed very complex to me. \
Now, although it still seems like a pretty difficult world to me, I have decided to start learning.&#x20;

Here you can find write-ups of the machines I have completed on platforms like Hack The Box or TryHackMe, as well as some resources I find useful.

If you want to take a look at my profiles on these platforms, here are a couple of links:
